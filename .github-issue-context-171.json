  "body": "## Feature Request\n\nCurrently the notification bar in the tmux status line only shows sessions with `StatusWaiting`. When attached to a session, I'd like to see **all other sessions** (running, idle, waiting, error) so I can quickly switch between them with `Ctrl+b 1-6`.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nThe notification bar only appears when another session transitions to \"waiting\" state, and is cleared once you attach to that session. When inside a session, you have no visibility into your other sessions.\n\nFrom the debug logs:\n```\nbar_updated: \"⚡ [1] test\"       (current_session_id: \"\")\nbar_updated: \"\"                   (current_session_id: \"ef515f19...\")\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nA config option like `show_all` under `[notifications]` that shows all sessions (excluding the currently attached one) in the notification bar, with status indicators:\n\n```toml\n[notifications]\n  enabled = true\n  show_all = true    # show all sessions, not just waiting\n```\n\nBar output would look like:\n```\n⚡ [1] ● frontend [2] ◐ api [3] ○ backend\n```\n\nWhere `●` = running, `◐` = waiting, `○` = idle, `✕` = error.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\nThe change is small and contained to 3 files:\n\n1. **`internal/session/userconfig.go`** — Add `ShowAll bool` to `NotificationsConfig` struct\n2. **`internal/session/notifications.go`** — In `SyncFromInstances()` line 176, change the filter condition:\n   ```go\n   // Current (waiting only):\n   if inst.GetStatusThreadSafe() == StatusWaiting && inst.ID != currentSessionID {\n   \n   // With show_all:\n   if inst.ID != currentSessionID && (showAll || inst.GetStatusThreadSafe() == StatusWaiting) {\n   ```\n3. **`internal/session/notifications.go`** — In `FormatBar()`, optionally include a status icon per entry\n4. **`internal/ui/home.go`** — Pass the `ShowAll` config through to the notification manager\n\nThe `currentSessionID` exclusion should still be kept (no need to see your own session in the bar).\n\n## Use Case\n\nWhen running multiple concurrent AI coding sessions, I want to see all of them in the tmux status bar so I can jump between them instantly — not just the ones that happen to be waiting. This makes the multi-session workflow much more fluid.",
