  "title": "Support Shift+Enter for multi-line input in TUI dialogs",
  "body": "## Problem\n\nWhen using agent-deck with terminals that support the Kitty Keyboard Protocol (e.g., Ghostty), **Shift+Enter does not create a newline** in input fields. This makes it difficult to compose multi-line prompts when creating or forking sessions.\n\nAdditionally, **text selection and copy don't work as expected** when attached to sessions, since tmux mouse mode intercepts these events.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n- Input dialogs use single-line `textinput.Model` components\n- No alternative keybinding exists for inserting newlines (Alt+Enter, Ctrl+j, etc.)\n- Users must pre-compose multi-line text externally and paste it\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Upgrade to Bubble Tea v2** with progressive keyboard enhancements to support Shift+Enter detection via the Kitty Keyboard Protocol\n2. **Use `textarea.Model`** instead of `textinput.Model` for fields where multi-line input is useful (e.g., session prompts)\n3. Alternatively, add a fallback keybinding like **Alt+Enter** or **Ctrl+Enter** for newlines\n\n## Environment\n\n- Terminal: Ghostty (supports Kitty Keyboard Protocol)\n- OS: macOS\n\n## References\n\n- [Bubble Tea v2 keyboard enhancements](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/discussions/1374)\n- [Bubble Tea textarea linebreaks discussion](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/issues/800)",
