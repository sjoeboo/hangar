  "title": "Feature: Group-level default working directory",
  "body": "## Feature Request\n\n**Problem:**\nWhen working with session groups, every new session requires manually specifying the working directory path. There's no way to configure a group so that new sessions automatically open in a specific directory.\n\nThis is especially noticeable with worktree workflows — if you create a worktree in one session within a group, new sessions in the same group don't inherit that worktree's directory. You have to re-specify the path or `--worktree` flag each time.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nAdd a group-level `default_path` configuration option so that new sessions created within a group automatically use that directory as their working directory.\n\nThis could work as:\n\n1. **A group property** set at creation or update time:\n   ```bash\n   agent-deck group create my-group --default-path /path/to/project\n   agent-deck group update my-group --default-path /path/to/project\n   ```\n\n2. **Inherited by new sessions** — when pressing `n` in the TUI or using `agent-deck add` with `-g my-group` without an explicit path, the group's `default_path` would be used.\n\n3. **Overridable** — explicitly passing a path to `agent-deck add` would still take precedence.\n\n**Use Case:**\n- A team member has a group called \"feature-x\" tied to a specific worktree at `repo/.worktrees/feature-x`\n- Every new session in that group should default to that worktree directory\n- Currently they must remember and type the full path each time\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Always specifying the path manually (current behavior — tedious and error-prone)\n- Using shell aliases (works but is external to AgentDeck)",
