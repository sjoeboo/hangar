## [0.8.91] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix TUI cursor not following notification bar session switch after detach (Ctrl+b N during attach now moves cursor to the switched-to session on Ctrl+Q)

## [0.8.90] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix quit dialog ("Keep running" / "Shut down") hidden behind splash screen, causing infinite hang on quit with MCP pool
- Fix `isQuitting` flag not reset when canceling quit dialog with Esc
- Add 5s safety timeouts to status worker and log worker waits during shutdown

## [0.8.89] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix shutdown hang when quitting with "shut down" MCP pool option (process `Wait()` blocked forever on child-held pipes)
- Set `cmd.Cancel` (SIGTERM) and `cmd.WaitDelay` (3s) on MCP processes for graceful shutdown with escalation
- Add 5s safety timeout to individual proxy `Stop()` and 10s overall timeout to pool `Shutdown()`

## [0.8.88] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix stale expanded group state during reload causing cursor jumps when CLI adds a session while TUI is running
- Fix new groups added via CLI appearing collapsed instead of expanded
- Eliminate redundant tree rebuild and viewport sync during reload (performance)

## [0.8.87] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- Add `env` field to custom tool definitions for inline environment variables (closes #101)
- Custom tools from config.toml now appear in the TUI command picker with icons
- CLI `agent-deck add -c <custom-tool>` resolves tool to actual command automatically

### Fixed

- Fix `[worktree] default_location = "subdirectory"` config not being applied (fixes #110)
- Add `--location` CLI flag to override worktree placement per session (`sibling` or `subdirectory`)
- Worktree location now respects config in both CLI and TUI new session dialog

## [0.8.86] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix changelog display dropping unrecognized lines (plain text paragraphs now preserved)
- Fix trailing-slash path completion returning directory name instead of listing contents
- Reset path autocomplete state when reopening new session dialog
- Fix double-close on LogWatcher and StorageWatcher (move watcher.Close inside sync.Once)
- Fix log worker shutdown race (replace unused channel with sync.WaitGroup)
- Fix CapturePane TOCTOU race with singleflight deduplication

### Added
