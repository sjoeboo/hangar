# Changelog

All notable changes to Agent Deck will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-02

### Changed

- **Group dialog defaults to root mode on grouped sessions**: Pressing `g` while the cursor is on a session inside a group now opens the "Create New Group" dialog in root mode instead of subgroup mode. Tab toggle still switches to subgroup. Group headers still default to subgroup mode. This makes it easier for users with all sessions in groups to create new root-level groups

### Added

- **MCP socket pool resilience docs**: README updated to mention automatic ~3s crash recovery via reconnecting proxy
- **Pattern override documentation**: `config.toml init` now includes documentation for `busy_patterns_extra`, `prompt_patterns_extra`, and `spinner_chars_extra` fields for extending built-in tool detection patterns

## [0.9.2] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **492% CPU usage**: Main TUI process was consuming 5 CPU cores due to reading 100-841MB JSONL files every 2 seconds per Claude session. Now uses tail-read (last 32KB only) with file-size caching to skip unchanged files entirely
- **Duplicate notification sync**: Both foreground TUI tick and background worker were running identical notification sync every 2 seconds, spawning duplicate tmux subprocesses. Removed foreground sync since background worker handles everything
- **Excessive tmux subprocess spawns**: `GetEnvironment()` spawned `tmux show-environment` every 2 seconds per Claude session for session ID lookup. Added 30-second cache since session IDs rarely change
- **Unnecessary idle session polling**: Claude/Gemini/Codex session tracking updates now skip idle sessions where nothing changes

### Added

- Configurable pattern detection system: `ResolvedPatterns` with compiled regexes replaces hardcoded busy/prompt detection, enabling pattern overrides via `config.toml`

## [0.9.1] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **MCP socket proxy 64KB crash**: `bufio.Scanner` default 64KB limit caused socket proxy to crash when MCPs like context7 or firecrawl returned large responses. Increased buffer to 10MB, preventing orphaned MCP processes and permanent "failed" status
- **Faster MCP failure recovery**: Health monitor interval reduced from 10s to 3s for quicker detection and restart of failed proxies
- **Active client disconnect on proxy failure**: When socket proxy dies, all connected clients are now actively closed so reconnecting proxies detect failure immediately instead of hanging

### Added

- **Reconnecting MCP proxy** (`agent-deck mcp-proxy`): New subcommand replaces `nc -U` as the stdio bridge to MCP sockets. Automatically reconnects with exponential backoff when sockets drop, making MCP pool restarts invisible to Claude sessions (~3s recovery)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Fork worktree isolation**: Fork dialog (`F` key) now includes an opt-in worktree toggle for git repos. When enabled, the forked session gets its own git worktree directory, isolating Claude Code project state (plan, memory, attachments) between parent and fork (#123)
- Auto-suggested branch name (`fork/<session-name>`) in fork dialog when worktree is enabled
- CLI `session fork` command gains `-w/--worktree <branch>` and `-b/--new-branch` flags for worktree-based forks
- Branch validation in fork dialog using existing git helpers

## [0.8.99] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **Session reorder persistence**: Reordering sessions with Shift+K/J now persists across reloads. Added `Order` field to session instances, normalized on every move, and sorted by Order on load. Legacy sessions (no Order field) preserve their original order via stable sort (#119)

## [0.8.98] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- **Claude Code 2.1.25+ busy detection**: Claude Code 2.1.25 removed `"ctrl+c to interrupt"` from the status line, causing all sessions to appear YELLOW/GRAY instead of GREEN while working. Detection now uses the unicode ellipsis (`…`) pattern: active state shows `"✳ Gusting… (35s · ↑ 673 tokens)"`, done state shows `"✻ Worked for 54s"` (no ellipsis)
- Status line token format detection updated to match new `↑`/`↓` arrow format (`(35s · ↑ 673 tokens)`)
- Content normalization updated for asterisk spinner characters (`·✳✽✶✻✢`) to prevent false hash changes

### Changed

- Analytics preview panel now defaults to OFF (opt-in via `show_analytics = true` in config.toml)

### Added

- 6 new whimsical thinking words: `billowing`, `gusting`, `metamorphosing`, `sublimating`, `recombobulating`, `sautéing`
- Word-list-independent spinner detection regex for future-proofing against new Claude Code words

## [0.8.97] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed

- **CLI session ID capture**: `session start`, `session restart`, `session fork`, and `try` now persist Claude session IDs to JSON immediately, enabling fork and resume from CLI-only workflows without the TUI
- Fork pre-check recovery: `session fork` attempts to recover missing session IDs from tmux before failing, fixing sessions started before this fix
- Stale comment in `loadSessionData` corrected to reflect lazy loading behavior

### Added

- `PostStartSync()` method on Instance for synchronous session ID capture after Start/Restart (CLI-only; TUI uses its existing background worker)

## [0.8.96] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **HTTP Transport Support for MCP Servers**: Native support for HTTP/SSE MCP servers with auto-start capability
- Add `[mcps.X.server]` config block for auto-starting HTTP MCP servers (command, args, env, startup_timeout, health_check)
- Add `mcp server` CLI commands: `start`, `stop`, `status` for managing HTTP MCP servers
- Add transport type indicators in `mcp list`: `[S]`=stdio, `[H]`=http, `[E]`=sse
- Add TUI MCP dialog transport indicators with status: `●`=running, `○`=external, `✗`=stopped
- Add HTTP server pool with health monitoring and automatic restart of failed servers
- External server detection: if URL is already reachable, use it without spawning a new process

### Changed

- MCP dialog now shows transport type and server status for each MCP
- `mcp list` output now includes transport type column

## [0.8.95] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- **Performance: TUI startup ~3x faster** (6s → 2s for 44 sessions)
- Batch tmux operations: ConfigureStatusBar (5→1 call), EnableMouseMode (6→2 calls) using command chaining
- Lazy loading: defer non-essential tmux configuration until first attach or background tick
- Skip UpdateStatus and session ID sync at load time (use cached status from JSON)

### Added

- Add `ReconnectSessionLazy()` for deferred session configuration
- Add `EnsureConfigured()` method for on-demand tmux setup
- Add `SyncSessionIDsToTmux()` method for on-demand session ID sync
- Background worker gradually configures unconfigured sessions (one per 2s tick)

## [0.8.94] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- Add undo delete (Ctrl+Z) for sessions: press Ctrl+Z after deleting a session to restore it including AI conversation resume. Supports multiple undos in reverse order (stack of up to 10)
- Show ^Z Undo hint in help bar (compact and full modes) when undo stack is non-empty
- Add Ctrl+Z entry to help overlay (? screen)

### Changed

- Update delete confirmation dialog: "This cannot be undone" → "Press Ctrl+Z after deletion to undo"

## [0.8.93] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix `g` key unable to create root-level groups when any group exists (#111). Add Tab toggle in the create-group dialog to switch between Root and Subgroup modes
- Fix `n` key handler using display name constant instead of path constant for default group

### Added

- Group DefaultPath tracking: groups now track the most recently accessed session's project path via `updateGroupDefaultPath`

## [0.8.92] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix CI test failure in `TestBindUnbindKey` by making default key restore best-effort in `UnbindKey`

## [0.8.91] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix TUI cursor not following notification bar session switch after detach (Ctrl+b N during attach now moves cursor to the switched-to session on Ctrl+Q)

## [0.8.90] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix quit dialog ("Keep running" / "Shut down") hidden behind splash screen, causing infinite hang on quit with MCP pool
- Fix `isQuitting` flag not reset when canceling quit dialog with Esc
- Add 5s safety timeouts to status worker and log worker waits during shutdown

## [0.8.89] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix shutdown hang when quitting with "shut down" MCP pool option (process `Wait()` blocked forever on child-held pipes)
- Set `cmd.Cancel` (SIGTERM) and `cmd.WaitDelay` (3s) on MCP processes for graceful shutdown with escalation
- Add 5s safety timeout to individual proxy `Stop()` and 10s overall timeout to pool `Shutdown()`

## [0.8.88] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fix stale expanded group state during reload causing cursor jumps when CLI adds a session while TUI is running

### Fixed

- Fix changelog display dropping unrecognized lines (plain text paragraphs now preserved)
- Fix trailing-slash path completion returning directory name instead of listing contents
